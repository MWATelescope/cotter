The MWA and the EoR, RFI and a new imaging algorithm.

The 128-tile Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has been operating for a few months now, and observing for the Epoch Of Reionisation (EoR) and survey projects has begun. I will give an observational update on the EoR project and discuss a few specific parts of MWA data reduction. The latter will mostly follow one (of multiple) pipelines for processing EoR data. This particular pipeline is aimed at measuring the spectral information in extra-galactic sources in our EoR fields with unprecedented accuracy. The spectral energy distributions of these sources might be interesting themselves, but these sources also form the EoR foregrounds and will need to be subtracted. Therefore, having a good understanding of these sources is important. To get sufficiently accurate calibration solutions, a full-polarization calibration is performed and the brightest sources are peeled out. Two other specific steps of this pipeline will be discussed: the Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) detection results and "wsclean", a novel imager implementation. This new imager uses the w-stacking algorithm to make accurate widefield images with a performance that is over an order of magnitude faster than the "de facto" widefield implementation, i.e., the w-projection implementation in Casa. I will also show imaging results of the first nights of EoR data.
