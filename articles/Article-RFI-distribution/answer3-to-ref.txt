Dear referee,

Thank you for your final suggestion. Your comment was:

"Some readers may find your newly-added sentence on page 3 confusing:

"It is common knowledge that in a uniform Euclidian Universe source counts behave like power-law distributions. For sources on a flat surface, the power law will have a -2 exponent."

For a uniform 3D distribution, the power-law exponent of the cumulative counts is -3/2: N(>S) \propto S^{-3/2}. This follows from the number of sources within a radius r being N proportional to r^3, while the maximum distance to which sources of a given luminosity can be seen above flux density S is r \propto S^{-1/2} (inverse square law).

For your 2D distribution of sources in 3D space, with isotropic radiators, N is now \propto r^2, while r \propto S{-1/2} is unchanged, giving N(S) \propto S^{-1}, not -2.

You appear to be quoting the slope of the *differential*  counts, dN(S)/dS \propto S^{-2}, and it would be clearer if you said so, given that source counts are traditionally described in the integral form.

(Incidentally, this method of deriving the result seems to me to be to be easier to follow than your equations 2-5)."

We agree with your suggestion, and made the following change:

Page 3, section 2, start of 3rd paragraph

"It is common knowledge that in a uniform Euclidian Universe source counts behave like power-law distributions. For sources on a flat surface, the power law will have a -2 exponent."

Was changed to:

"It is common knowledge that in a uniform Euclidian Universe source counts behave like power-law distributions. The differential source-count distribution for sources on a flat surface is a power law with -2 exponent."

Nothing else was changed in the article.

Thank you for your help in improving the paper.
