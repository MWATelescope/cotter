(R) -- referee comment
(A) -- our answer

(R) This paper has two primary findings:  (1) The statistical distribution of intensities of time-frequency pixels in visibilities can be anticipated from simple modeling (at LOFAR frequencies) and (2) The results suggest that a LOFAR EoR detection will not be prevented by RFI.  My general assessment of the paper is that the first finding is reasonable, although is presented in a confusing and unnecessarily complicated way, but that the second finding is not well supported.  I think this paper potentially makes a useful contribution and could be suitable for publication if the work related to the first finding is presented in a more clear and concise manner, and if work related to the second finding is either presented in a more compelling way, or excluded. 

(A) We have revised the issues related to point (1). Concerning point (2), it is unclear to us why the referee does not find our arguments compelling, as no detailed explanation is given on his view. The last section in the paper discusses this topic, but the referee has no comments on this section, thus we assume he agrees with the individual arguments. For example, the last sentence of our paper is:

"The current results indicate that a lot of RFI does not add up consistently, and the situation is promising. Considering the current RFI results, and the availability of further mitigation steps, we conclude that RFI will likely not be problematic for the detection of the Epoch of Reionisation with LOFAR."

We think the arguments given here are by itself already sufficiently strong to make our conclusion. Moreover, there's no evidence showing RFI will be a problem, we already anticipate flagging on integrated data to find the low-level RFI as described, and we show that our detector is accurate enough to detect RFI slightly below the noise level. Also, a first result has been published showing that no RFI accumulates at the NCP (Sect 4.3 of Yatawatta et al, 2013).

We have weakened the statement in the abstract slightly, to say that it is "likely" that a LOFAR EoR detection will not be prevented by RFI, and think this is more than warranted by the arguments given.

General comments:
=================

(R) The frequency range which is addressed should be clearly identified in the abstract & introduction, and relevance/irrelevance to other frequency bands in the radio spectrum should be addressed.
(A) Added range to abstract. The relevance to other frequency bands is not fully clear and a follow-up on other frequencies might be interesting, but we think it is not necessary to mention this in the abstract.

(R) The derivation of section 2 and continuing intermittently throughout the paper is unnecessarily sprawling and difficult to follow.  It's clear that the distribution follows a power law with exponent between -1 and -2, and typically about -1.5 assuming a path loss factor consistent with terrestrial propagation.  This result can be obtained in just a few steps from very simple considerations.  Instead the authors follow a very convoluted route with a few false starts and extraneous information (invoking for example the Hata model) and get essentially the expected result. 

(A) To shorten the discussion, we've removed the section on the spherical geometry. However, we disagree with the statement that the derivation of the histogram slope is unnecessary sprawling. We believe it is not common knowledge that RFI creates a power law with an exponent around -1.5, and haven't found papers stating this. Our derivation in Sect. 2 in which we show that free propagating RFI would show a -2 distribution takes one page and 5 steps (Eq 1-5). Many non-trivial but relevant assumptions are mentioned here, including coherency properties and the I, g and rho parameters. While it might be possible to skip a step, we think it would not improve the reader's understanding. Many of the equations are also required for establishing a model further in the article. The derivation of the Hata model takes half a page, but provides a thorough understanding of how propagation affects the power law. This includes the conclusion that frequency & receiver height do not affect the power law, while transmitter height does. This is not well known, and we believe this has not been derived in any publication before. We think that the mathematical approach is scientifically more convincing than skipping over the assumptions and derivations.

(R) One thing that strikes me from reading about RFI surveys and my own experience with radio astronomy is that there seems to be two distinct "populations" of RFI:  Sources which are strong and obvious (like TV transmitters, or mobile radio transmissions with transmit frequencies following a known spacing), and sources which are weak and mysterious (the splatter in figure 1 may be a good example).  Treating these all as one population seems weird to me, since the first category is so easily characterized and/or avoided, after which all that is left is the second category, which seems to be the *real* threat to 21 cm cosmology experiments. Perhaps this dichotomy can be addressed?  For example, with respect to the discussion of Sec 5.1 second paragraph.

(A) We think the situation for LOFAR is not really like that: we see hundreds of unknown RFI sources with LOFAR, almost all of which are detected with our detector. These dominate the distribution. We do not try to classify a source into being of unknown origin or not, but we (briefly) describe what the distribution is at different frequencies. We've not noticed two classes of power laws on different frequencies, as the power-law becomes only sufficiently apparent when combining many frequencies (see sect 5.1, second paragraph). This implies that the few obvious transmitters we know of do not dominate the histogram, otherwise they would show up in the individual subbands.

(R) Reading this paper I was reminded of the following paper by A.E.E. Rogers of MIT/Haystack (also doing work on 21 cm cosmology at radio frequencies) on very sensitive "interference temperature" measurements from 70 MHz up in the US Northeast: 
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/arrays/deut/pdf/dyspan_rogers_2005.pdf
I wonder: Are the findings of the Rogers paper consistent with those of this paper in terms of the efficacy of EoR detection considering interference?  Perhaps there are other RFI surveys that pertain to this issue?
(A) This is indeed an interesting paper in this context and we have added a brief discussion to section 6 ("The apparent RFI flux densities can be converted to a RFI station temperature [..]")

(R) The statistics pertain to amplitudes of the visibilities.  It is well-known that terrestrial propagation involving mobile transmitters in this frequency range is subject to both significant doppler shifting (due to relative motion) and orders-of-magnitude wavelength-scale "fast fading" (due to plurality of multipaths arriving at the receiver).  However the paper seems to ignore these instead focusses (with excessive detail, I would argue) on path loss on geographical scales (only).  I can't say for sure, but it seems possible that doppler and fast fading effects may significantly affect the distribution of the visibility amplitudes.  I think this should be addressed. 
(A) Due to the velocity resolution of 1.5 km/s, we've not observed any Doppler shift with LOFAR except on very fast satellites. To actually decorrelate, a source should have a speed difference of 1.5 km/s between the antennas, which is nearly impossible. The same holds for fast fading, which also only occurs if moving sources are involved (or reflection on a turbulant ionosphere). Even if these effects were significant, they would be absorbed as a term in parameter 'g' (gain), and this term will be limited and distributed in such a way it won't affect the power-law in the histogram. E.g., ionospheric fading is sometimes modelled with a Rayleigh distribution (Rayleigh fading), and as described in Sect 2.4, such terms do not affect the power law. We've added some clarification on this, see the more specific comments below for our addition to the paper.

(R) LOFAR EoR observations are referred to, but not sufficiently well addressed.  To make the conclusion that RFI will not hurt this observing program, enough detail about the program should be clearly stated that the reader is able to make this assessment.  Similarly, there is reference to "AOFlagger" which is reasonably referenced/cited, but which nevertheless should be explained in sufficient detail to allow the reader of this paper to make the assessment as to whether RFI observed + AOFlagger is sufficient to allow the detection.  Alternatively, present results in manner which is independent of the specific instrument and RFI mitigation software employed.
(A) We've added descriptions of the the EoR project (in Sect 1) and the AOFlagger (in Sect 4).

(R) The coining of terms and the consistency of the use of terms is a severe problem in this paper.  Examples include names of types of statistical distributions, the multiple definitions/uses of the term "source", "time-frequency plot" vs. "dynamic spectrum", the confusing term "frequency density", multiple definitions of the term "coherent" and so on.  This makes the paper quite difficult to understand.
(A) We've changed the paper to use these terms consistently.

(R) I don't see that the possibility that some fraction of clutter in the dynamic spectrum which is detected as RFI might actually be intermodulation distortion generated within the receivers.  Has this been considered and determined (how?) to be negligible?   
(A) We are aware of the occurance of some non-linearity in the receiver, as briefly mentioned in Sect 5.1. If intermodulation or other non-linearity occurs, it is as if a transmitter is spread over a larger bandwidth. This can be absorbed in the "rho" (density) parameter, but won't affect the accuracy of our analysis.

Specific comments:
==================

(R) Abstract: "long time integration" -- awkward.
(A) Changed to "long integration"

(R) Abstract: "stationary and consistently" -- means what specifically?  Is "consistent" somehow distinct from "stationary"?
(A) Removed "stationary"

(R) Abstract: "low frequency RFI" means what frequencies/sources specifically?
(A) added frequency range

(R) Abstract: "would imply" --> "implies"
(A) Changed

(R) Abstract: "imply that the current LOFAR EoR observations should be severely RFI limited if these sources add up consistently" -- not clear specifically what "add up consistently" means.
(A) explained with: "...if the strength of RFI sources remain strong after integration"

(R) Abstract: "most RFI sources do not linearly increase the noise" -- I could not decipher this comment, even after multiple readings of the relevant section of the paper.
(A) Changed to "it is unlikely that there are undetected RFI sources that will become visible after long integration"

(R) Abstract: "We believe that RFI will not prevent an EoR detection" -- "believe"? I suspect this is just a matter of semantics, but either there is compelling evidence, or there is not.
(A) Reworded
  
(R) Sec 1, Col 1, Line 33: "mitigate this effect" -- there is no one "effect"; there are many "effects" depending on the RFI and the observation type.
(A) changed to "their effects"

(R) Sec 1, Col 1, Line 39-42: "these methods excise enough of the interference" -- Suggests these methods are actually in widespread use; I am not aware that this is true.  Certainly is not true at North American observatories.
(A) I agree that some methods are probably not in widespread use, but at least the referenced detection/flagging methods are in widespread use, also e.g. at the VLA and especially at low frequencies, as it can be found in the various LOFAR, PAPER or MWA papers, that all describe automated detectors. We have weekened the statement slightly:
"The careful management of spectrum allocation and the construction of radio-quiet zones help to limit the number of harmful transmitters. If harmful RFI is observed nevertheless, the use of RFI mitigation methods can sometimes clean the data sufficiently to allow succesful calibration and imaging."

(R) Sec 1, Col 1, line 50: "coherently" -- not sure this is really what the authors meant.  Maybe "persistently"?
(A) Changed to "persistently"

(R) Sec 1, Col 2, Line 31: "van Haalem et al. 2013" does not appear in the reference list
(A) Added.

(R) Sec 1, Col 2, Lines 50-54: Not clear what a "differential" vs. "cumulative" distribution is.  The definition of "cumulative distribution function" (CDF) is well known -- are the authors using the standard definition?  If so, maybe "differential distribution" means "probability density function" (PDF), which is the derivative of the CDF?
(A) Yes, we are using normal PDFs and CDFs. In cosmology, terms like "differential galaxy counts" are sometimes used, hence we thought this explanation would help. We've now removed this comment altogether.

(R) Sec 1, Col 2, Line 51: "histogram" -- suddenly using this term.  Related to "differential" or "cumulative" distribution how?  (Perhaps "histogram" = PDF?)
(A) We've slightly clarified it by changing it to "...and analyse brightness histograms of LOFAR data". We are not sure the referee also dislikes the term 'histogram', but we believe we are using the term histogram here in the commonly used form: to refer to the distribution of the data as measured, whereas the term PDF refers to the underlying function that models the data. We think this is common terminology, and the relation between histogram and distribution is clear by the term.

(R) Sec 2, Col 2, Line 60: "airplanes and satellites" are not sources by themselves.  They may have on-board transmitters which are sources; if so, be clear about what systems are of concern.  Alternatively, they may reflect ground based transmitters.  
(A) We don't want to make a distinction between RFI from on-board transmitters or because of reflection here. Both can occur; at lower frequencies, reflection is quite common, while active transmissions occur at frequencies around 130 MHz for air-traffic communication. However, it's not (always) the only transmitted RFI from an airplane.

(R) Sec 2, Col 2, Page 4, Line 35: "frequency density' is an extremely confusing term.  How about "rate density"?  (many places in paper)
(A) Agreed; while "frequency density" is the standard statistics term, it is confusing in the context of radio astronomy. Changed all occurences to "rate density".

(R) Equation (1):  Given the definitions in the associated text, appears to be dimensionally incorrect:  If "I" is flux density (e.g., Jy) then "S" has units of Jy * m^{-2}; yet the paper seems to treat them as if "I" and "S" had the same units.
(A) We had absorbed the "flux density" to "flux density per unit area" factor (and its units) in the gains, which we agree is not precise. We've changed the units of I to "the transmitting power normalized by the observational channel resolution (e.g., measured in W/Hz)", which also adds a 4pi term to the formulae.

(R) Sec 2, Col 1, Page 4, Lines 51-57:  Implies sources ("transmitters" in this case, I assume) will appear as coherent ("highly or perfectly correlated" in this case, I assume) at different antennas in the array.  This true for unmoving transmitters, but wrong for moving transmitters, which experience significant doppler. The doppler is sufficiently large that mobile digital comm receivers operating in the frequency range must track frequency in order to function properly.  So, there's no way that signals from mobile transmitters can be considered coherent between the widely-separated receiving antennas of an interferometer.
(A) We do not agree with this; as said, due to the velocity resolution of 1.5 km/s, we've not observed any Doppler shift with LOFAR except on very fast satellites. To actually decorrelate, a source should have a speed difference of 1.5 km/s between the antennas, which is nearly impossible. We've added:

"Because the velocity resolution of LOFAR is 1.5~km/s at 150~MHz, and larger at lower frequencies, a Doppler frequency shift due to movement of the source will only be significant if its velocity is at least 1.5~km/s relative to the antennas. Since the relative velocities towards different antennas in the array will be similar for such high-velocity transmitters (i.e., satellites), there will be hardly any decorrelation because of Doppler shifting."

(R) Sec 2, Col 1, Page 4, Lines 54: "Bandwidth of the signal \delta\nu = 1 kHz" -- very few signals present in this frequency range have an occupied bandwidth this narrow.  Typical is 5 - 50 kHz.  Maybe the authors mean spectral resolution.
(A) We agree, we meant spectral resolution.

(R) Sec 2, Col 2, Page 4, Line 24 "we need the reverse" -- you mean "inverse"?
(A) Changed to "complement"

(R) Fig 1: Units of time and relative to what time?
(A) Added "(h, UTC)"

(R) Sec 2.2, Page 5, Col 1, Line 47: "sub-urban" --> "suburban"
(A) Changed

(R) Sec 2.2, Page 5, Col 1, Lines 49-53: Define "Loss" in this case? 
(A) Added "between two ground-based antennas"

(R) Equations 9-10:  I was not able to determine what is the point of defining this quantity.  Does not seem to be used in the paper.  Also, seems dimensionally incorrect.  
(A) (these are now equation 7-8) Equation 7 presents what the exponential dependency in the loss-factor is (the exponent is later named Eta) and shows how Zeta is extracted. Equation 9 uses both Eta and Zeta as defined in 7 and 8, thus both equations are used. By deriving Equation 7, it is also shown that the power-law exponent is not depending on frequency, receiver height and urban density. Although Eq 7 is an intermediate step and technically we could go from Eq 6 + 8 straight to Eq 10, we think it is helpful understanding the derivation. Eq 7 is dimensionally equal to Eq 6, which is coming from the cited paper by Hata, except that the 1/10 x exp10 was taken on both sides to be able to apply the formula on flux densities. Since it is an emperical formula converting distance and other quantities to an energy loss without full theoretical derivation, it is an implicit assumption that it converts one dimensionality (the right hand side) to another (1/distance^2), and our assumption is the same as in the paper by Hata, which is very often used (can be seen from its high number of citations). We don't think that discussing dimensionality here will be useful, as it will only distract the reader from the main points here, which are the implications of Hata's formula on the observed power-law distribution.

To make the use of the equations more clear, we have added:
L_S = 1/10 10^L_p = ..
to Eq 7 and "as seen in Eq. (7)" below below Eq. 9.

(R) Figure 3's vertical axis is labeled "probability density" -- so this is a PDF (or histogram)?  The integral of a PDF should equal 1 (i.e., the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes should be 1) -- is that really true for both curves (and in particular the "-2 power law distribution)?
(A) The -2 power-law distribution example did indeed not integrate to 1. We've corrected this (which requires the power law to have a lower cut-off).

(R) Figure 4 "Frequency density" -- units?
(A) Changed to "Rate density (count)"

(R) Section 2.3 Page 6 Col 2 paragraph beginning "to understand the distribution of samples..." -- I am baffled by this paragraph.  OK, so RFI and noise add coherently, and that influences the statistical distribution of amplitudes.  So...?
(A) paragraph indeed unnecessary, removed.

(R) Section 2.3 Page 6 Col 2 Line 58 "U(0,1)" -- not clear -- maybe this means  "uniformly distributed over [0,1]"?
(A) Yes, clarified.

(R) Sec 2.3 Page 7 Col 1 Line 21 "phased array beam" -- seems the discussion has suddenly become LOFAR-specific?  Presumably "phased array beam" means "station beam", and the interferometer is now an array of these station beams?
(A) Since it is indeed not a requirement to have phased-array beams for this statement to be valid, we've removed "phased-array" to keep this point generic.

(R) Sec 2.3 Page 7 Col 1 Lines 23-34:  This seems to me to be a somewhat long-winded and repetitive way of pointing out that RFI shows up as a tail distribution on top of the expected Gaussian noise distribution.  
(A) Agree, paragraph removed.

(R) Sec 2.4 Page 7 Col 1 Line 52: "they act like stochastic variables"?  Maybe you mean they "are" or "can be modeled as"? 
(A) Changed to "are"

(R) Second paragraph in Sec 2.4 seems out of place -- shouldn't this go with the description of the dataset?
(A) While we do indeed mention the data here already, we mainly discuss gain variation in the data and its relation to the histogram, and combine this with variation due to the other stochastic variables (such as I). Since the latter is not part of the data description, and we think it is useful to have the discussion of the gain variation and the other variables together, we think it is better to keep this paragraph at its current position. It's not necessary to have read Sect. 4 to understand this paragraph.

(R) Third paragraph in Sec 2.4:  Baffled by this entire paragraph.  For example "effect of the band-pass on the data distribution is consequently limited to one order of magnitude or less" -- one order of magnitude of what?  What specifically is meant by "effect of the band-pass"?
(A) We've removed the paragraph and replaced it with the following sentence: "The frequency dependency of the gains due to the band-pass will consequently smooth the data in the brightness histogram in horizontal direction by one order of magnitude or less."

(R) Sec 3.2 Page 8 Col 1 Line 9-10:  "slope estimated using linear regression over a visually-selected interval": OK, but then is it really reasonable to imply that the slope exponent can be determined with more than one signficant figure following the decimal point? 
(A) Yes, we think so. Uncertainty in selecting the range does not affect the certainty in the slope estimate significantly. For example, in simulations with 10^6 samples, changing the fitting range for the HBA an order of magnitude (i.e., one tick on the x-axis) to the right affects the slope estimate by only 0.002. Since the LBA/HBA histograms have many more samples, the uncertainty because of the visually selected interval can be neglected. We've also verified that changing the range slightly does not affect our estimates. Uncertainty because of variation in the curve is captured in our estimates of the standard error. Even our most pessimistic standard error of the slope estimate (epsilon_alpha in Table 2) says that we can estimate the slope more accurate than 0.1, so the second digit has value. Arguments could be given for how to select the interval based on where the Rayleigh distribution becomes insignificant, but this would make the discussion even more rigorous and add little value.

(R) Sec 3.2-3.3:  I don't specifically object, but I find this to be excessively rigorous for something that is ultimately limited by relatively bold assumptions and still requires a some "eyeballing" to set parameters.
(A) We have slightly shortened both sections. Sect 3.2 is brief, and since we use a method that is discouraged in science (fitting straight lines to a power-law distribution) it is good to mention why we do this and that we confirmed it. Section 3.3 is extensive, but introduces estimators that we think are very interesting. Without most of these estimators we do not have a full parameterization of the RFI distribution, and thus the distribution can not be simulated. The other estimators help to understand the effectivity of flagging, and the resulting measures provide an argument in the "LOFAR RFI is manageable" discussion. As said above, the uncertainty of roughly estimating the interval is negligable, thus our results are not depending on eyeballing.

(R) Sec 3.3 Page 9 Col 2 Line 6-7: "AOFlagger" suddenly comes into play.  Presumably this work is intended to be more broadly applicable than just to LOFAR using this RFI mitigation scheme?
(A) Added: "We use the AOFlagger for RFI detection, which will be described in Sect. 4. " before "In Offringa et al. (2013), the false-positives rate for the AOFlagger is estimated to be 0.5%."
and changed "which equals the [..] minus the 0.5% false positives." to "which equals the [..] minus the false positives."

We've extended the description of the AOFlagger in Sect. 4.

(R) Sec 3.4 "The current LOFAR SEFD is found to be approximately ...." -- no way these numbers can be generally true.  Since LOFAR uses phased array stations they must vary significantly as a function of beam pointing in zenith angle at least; but also with respect to beam pointing in RA/DEC and LST as well.  Also I am not aware of a reference that compellingly demonstrates LOFAR SEFD -- can this be identified/cited?
(A) They are officially given on the website of Astron, and these match approximately with our numbers, see:
- http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/lofar-imaging-capabilities-sensitivity/sensitivity-lofar-array/sensiti
In the reference "Haarlem et al., submitted 2013" (see final comment for obtaining), these numbers are also given, with a more extensive description of what they mean. The declination is taken into account, and the numbers provide an "average" SEFD for typical observations. In the reference Yatawatta et al. 2013, it is shown that 6h NCP observations almost achieve the imaging noise corresponding to this SEFD for the HBA (the main limitation is assumed to be calibration issues & off-axis sources).

(R) Sec 4, first paragraph:  Not indicated how the receiving antennas are geographically positioned, and especially how they are positioned with respect to known strong transmitters and population centers.  
(A) A full discussion about known transmitters would have to be rather extensive, which I think is out of the scope of this paper and already discussed in the referenced Offringa et al. 2013. We've added a brief summary: "The analyses will cover only Dutch stations. Each Dutch station consists of 96 dipole low-band antennas (LBA) and one or two fields totalling 48~tiles of 4x4 bow-tie high-band antennas (HBA). The core area of LOFAR is located near the village of Exloo in the Netherlands, where the station density is at its highest. The six most densely packed stations are on the Superterp, an elevated area surrounded by water situated 3~km North of Exloo. A radio-quiet zone of 2~km around the Superterp has been established, but is relatively small and households exist within 1~km of the Superterp."

(R) Table 1:  "Amount of RFI detected" is given in %.  What constitutes an "RFI detection"? i.e., what is the criterion for detection?  Saying "AOFlagger" considers it RFI (last paragraph of Sec 4) is not sufficient.
(A) A description of the detection approach has been added.

(R) Figure 6: "correlation coefficient" -- just want to be clear -- is this between stations, or between individual antennas?
(A) Between stations, added to Section 4: "In the two data sets, we have used the correlation coefficients of cross-correlated stations, i.e., the raw visibilities."

(R) First paragraph of Section 6:  This seems to me to be "overinterpreting" the results.
(A) There are multiple statements in this section. About "The found power-law exponents [..] can be explained by a uniform spatial distribution of RFI sources": There is not any other hypothesis on how such an accurate power law over such a large amplitude range could be created, so we think it is fair to say that our results imply a uniform distribution. We agree that the transmitter heights are more uncertain, but for the HBA the boundaries show that given the assumptions, these might be valid, and even though the LBA estimate seems off, the large uncertainty in the LBA slope does not reject the validity of the model. We've added the following sentences to accentuate the involved uncertainty: "[..] This translates to boundaries on the average transmitter height of [0.6; 800] and [3.1; 23] m for the LBA and HBA respectively. Therefore, the LBA measurements are clearly not accurate enough to be conclusive. Moreover, because the power-law distribution analyses involve many assumptions, it is uncertain whether the analyses are sufficiently accurate for making these detailed conclusions."

(R) Figure 11:  The large variation here seems to underscore my point that perhaps the mathematical derivation is over-detailed and implied precision of the model & model parameters is perhaps overstated.
(A) Our stated precision involves this variation, and the LBA uncertainty reflects its high variation. We do agree that the plot might be confusing: because this is a plot of the slope of a fit on small blocks of the data, its variation is naturally higher than in a single slope estimate over a larger range. It is very hard to see from this plot whether features are significant or are there because of sampling, which is why we need some of the mathematical derivations. We've now created this plot by samples the slope every order of magnitude, instead of sliding a window. This unsmooths the plot, which is a better representation of the limited amount of information in the plot.

(R) Equation (35): What is "N_feed" and "N_interferometers"?
(A) Added: "where N_feed=2 is the number of feeds per antenna and N_interferometers=1/2 60 x 59 is the number of interferometers."

(R) References identified as "submitted" do not appear in the reference list.  Also, it always strikes me as unreasonable to cite a "submitted" paper without somehow indicating how to get hold of a preprint.
(A) We agree, our apologees for this. We have asked the principal author of "van Haarlem et al., submitted 2013" to put the paper on Arxiv, but that might still take some time. We've requested permission to send the referee a draft of this paper. We have uploaded a draft version to: 
http://www.astro.rug.nl/~offringa/LOFAR_Overview_draft_1.9.pdf
It is not yet finalized.
