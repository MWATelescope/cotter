Hi Leon,

Bedankt voor al je nuttige feedback! Je noemt een aantal dingen waar ik nog niet aan gedacht had, dus erg nuttig! Inmiddels ook van vele anderen feedback gehad, dus het artikel is nog behoorlijk gewijzigd hier en daar.

De meeste puntjes heb ik verbeterd, hieronder nog wat reacties op je punten:

"Could the sources still be coherent, but concentrate near the horizon such that they do not show up near the
phase-center of images that are at high elevations? Can you exclude that scenario?"
- This is very briefly covered in Sect 6.2. When observing RFI sources at the horizon for longer durations, the sources will move through their own sidelobes in image plane. Therefore, they average out at their "actual" locations (i.e., near the horizon). However, their sidelobes will concentrate at the pole and this can cause artefacts to appear there. That can be good and bad...

"How is 'r' defined here. Comment in the text on this. Is it the shortest distance confined to the surface of a sphere
or is it the Euclidean distance in 3D space? This makes a difference. If is is the shortest distance on the surface
then eq. 2 & 3 are not correct. Coud you comment on this?"
- 'r' is Euclidean distance, now explained (and changed a bit after more comments).

Right below that:
"Only by approximation, correct? Just because r<<R. Maybe say this explicitly."
- Not sure what you mean with this; the distance of the Earth is in the end not important, because Equation (6) equals (3), thus by simplifying (6) the R can be removed. But the R appears when calculating surface etc., so R is supposed to be the exact diameter. This section has been rewritten btw.

"Is there any physics associated with this model? If so, maybe summarize it. Or is it no more than a fitting function?
It looks like a rather ugly function (eqn (7))."
- It is empirical and has no underlying physical model; they just fitted a function to measurements (but it is widely accepted and used).

"Why do you only use the information in the amplitude and not the phases to help separate RFi from signal. Could
this be done? Maybe comment on this."
- There might be some information in the phase indeed (and polarization as well). The main reason to do it like this was that it seems to capture most important information, and the derivations are slightly easier. I've quickly looked at phase distributions at some point, and I found that the phase distribution remains uniform, also for the RFI contaminated part of the data, so there is not immediately something interesting to be learned from it, although a detailed look might be interesting at some point... for now outside the scope I think.

In Sect 3.1:
"This is unclear. If you count in the bin and then divide by the bin width, you get the probability density. It's
convolved with the bin-size, but should not affect the slope that much if the bins are chosen narrow enough. Can
you clarify this? And why don't I see this in Fig.6 in the real data?"
- It is visible on the left, it looks a bit different because of the larger sample size, but it's a -1 slope. It's would also be visible on the rights side, but its outside the plotting window. It's just an artefact of the visualization; the points are connected, and there's just a high chance of having a few outlier samples, which then are connected by lines. Maybe drawing lines is not ideal, but it improves the image in the important parts.

5.1:
"This is COMPLETELTY the opposite statement that you make above just before Section 5 where you say that the
Hata model results in a slope that hardly depends on frequency. You should explain this."
- The first one is the theoretical prediction, the second is the results. We explain some causes for this difference after the sentence, this explanation has now also been advanced somewhat.

5.1:
"I can't see a logical connection here with the previous statement. If the beam shape changes, especially near the
ground plane, where most RFI comes from, why would this NOT affect the slope? The gain after the antenna
should not, but the beam should affect the slope."
- Because the the maximum gain will dominate the histogram. The explanation here (and earlier about parameter variability) has been improved somewhat.

5.1: about the source causing non-linearity:
"Have you been able to identify which source it could be? If so, maybe mention it. it could be important for future LOFAR LBA observations."
- No, but Michiel had some ideas about it (foreign tv station if I remember well). The source can be identifier in figs in the LOFAR radio environment paper (where it is also mentioned).

"This statement has never been clear to me also not by others. Why would this be true? If the RFI sources
coherently add in amplitude and especially phase, then they are spatially coherent/compact. In that case they
behave like any other source in the sky. Hence the error on their contribution to the visibilities will average away
like any other source of noise. Could you be more detailed on this particular statement, because its a quite
fundamental statement and it's not clear to me why it is true."
- See also my answer to the last point in this mail, but they are not as constant as a celestial sources, and can have sharp frequency response. That can convolve the source over the sky and makes them impossible to remove/deconvolve accurately like any other celestial source. We do not see that a lot, so maybe this not relevant in practice at all, but that's why it can be "in theory" (with certain assumptions). As you say, yes with other assumptions maybe it's not a problem at all.

about the noise per EoR night:
"We don't even get close to this number and it makes no sense to me."
- This was basically what I discussed with Ger, so... if you think the numnbers are incorrect please discuss it with him.


"What is missing is that most RFI sources are near the horizon and NOT in the EoR field. [..]"
- This is covered in the last part, describing the effect of the FFT. Note that sidelobes add consistently on the NCP (see final point).

"I think this is wrong. You do natural fringe-stopping because it's the NCP, so it should hold there as well."
I don't understand your remark; there's no change in geometric delay other than a constant term, so a fringe will keep the same speed. Hence, no fringe stopping...

"[..] The fact we don't see any RFI residuals in the NCP I think really comes from the fact that all/most RFI comes from far outside the station beam and hence smears over the entire sky/beam per emitter [..]"
- I don't disagree with that and I think we do mention this, but in a different way. Just for info, remember that sidelobes of things on the horizon do coherently add up at the pole, so they do not "smear" at that point. You mention a few times that RFI sources "only add sidelobes", but those sidelobes add consistently at the NCP for one baseline. If you calculate what a constant 1 Jy source will do in one baseline over a long time (12 h synthesis), you'll see it adds exactly 1 Jy on the NCP. This I have also simulated. At the NCP it can add destructively with other baselines, etc, and that effect is mentioned. But it's not entirely correct to say that being on the horizon is good enough for RFI sources to become fainter.

I am processing the feedback (I'll answer all replies), but since the LOFAR internal referees are still working on the paper, I thought it might be useful to move the deadline for the EoR group to 11 January. So, if you've missed the paper due to the holidays, I hope this provides a second chance :-) !

If you would like to be author on the paper, please read it carefully and give me your comments before January 1. There's a strict deadline, because there might be a paper in preparation that covers a similar subject, but I do appreciate feedback!
