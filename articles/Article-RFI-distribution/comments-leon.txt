Hi Leon,

Bedankt voor al je nuttige feedback! Je noemt een aantal dingen waar ik nog niet aan gedacht had, dus het is erg nuttig.

De meeste puntjes heb ik verbeterd, hieronder nog wat reacties op je punten:

"Could the sources still be coherent, but concentrate near the horizon such that they do not show up near the
phase-center of images that are at high elevations? Can you exclude that scenario?"
- This is very briefly covered in Sect 6.2. When observing RFI sources at the horizon for longer durations, the sources will move through their own sidelobes in image plane. Therefore, they average out at their "actual" locations (i.e., near the horizon). However, their sidelobes will concentrate at the pole and this can cause artefacts to appear there. That can be good and bad...

"How is 'r' defined here. Comment in the text on this. Is it the shortest distance confined to the surface of a sphere
or is it the Euclidean distance in 3D space? This makes a difference. If is is the shortest distance on the surface
then eq. 2 & 3 are not correct. Coud you comment on this?"
- 'r' is Euclidean distance.

Right below that:
"Only by approximation, correct? Just because r<<R. Maybe say this explicitly."
- Not sure what you mean with this; the distance of the Earth is in the end not important, because Equation (6) equals (3), thus by simplifying (6) the R can be removed. But the R appears when calculating surface etc., so R is supposed to be the exact diameter.

"Is there any physics associated with this model? If so, maybe summarize it. Or is it no more than a fitting function?
It looks like a rather ugly function (eqn (7))."
- It is empirical and has no underlying physical model; they just fitted a function to measurements (but it is widely accepted and used).

"Why do you only use the information in the amplitude and not the phases to help separate RFi from signal. Could
this be done? Maybe comment on this."
- There might be some information in the phase indeed (and polarization as well). The main reason to do it like this was that it would be easier. I've quickly looked at phase distributions at some point, and I found that the phase distribution remains uniform, also for the RFI contaminated part of the data, so there is not immediately something interesting to be learned from it, although a detailed look might be interesting at some point... for now outside the scope I think.

"[..] The fact we don't see any RFI residuals in the NCP I think really comes from the fact that all/most RFI comes from far outside the station beam and hence smears over the entire sky/beam per emitter [..]"
I don't disagree with that and I think we do mention this, but in a different way. Just for info, remember that sidelobes of things on the horizon do coherently add up at the pole, so they do not "smear" at that point. If you calculate what a constant 1 Jy source will do in one baseline over a long time, you'll see it adds exactly 1 Jy on the NCP. There it can add destructively with other baselines, etc, and that effect is mentioned. But it's not entirely correct to say that being on the horizon is good enough for RFI sources to become fainter.

I am processing the feedback (I'll answer all replies), but since the LOFAR internal referees are still working on the paper, I thought it might be useful to move the deadline for the EoR group to 11 January. So, if you've missed the paper due to the holidays, I hope this provides a second chance :-) !

If you would like to be author on the paper, please read it carefully and give me your comments before January 1. There's a strict deadline, because there might be a paper in preparation that covers a similar subject, but I do appreciate feedback!
