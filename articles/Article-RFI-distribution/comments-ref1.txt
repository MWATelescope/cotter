Dear referee,

Thank you for your valuable feedback. Below I will give an answer to each of your remarks. 

Kind regards,
AndrÃ© Offringa

I have no substantial comments on the content of the paper which seems well put together. One thing that I thought was lacking was a comparison to the paper of Scheuer (1957PCPS...53..764S) to which I find the method bears a marked similarity although the context/application is different.
- The paper has indeed some similarities, so I've now added a citation with a few sentences about this paper. Thank you for pointing that out. I don't think I can compare it more extensively than this, because Scheuer uses different math and it has a different context.

Minor points:

Intro, para 2 'to only excise' split infinitive
- Fixed

Intro, para 2 may be worth mentioning ground based CMB experiments to which the context is also relevant.
- Good idea, now mentioned.

Intro, para 2 LOFAR reference should be van Harlem et~al.
- Agree, referenced (is it already accepted?)

Intro, para 3 'von Hoerner 1973' this reference has been superceded by many more recent works. Something by Condon may be more appropriate.
- The paper closest to log N -- log S analysis I could find was Condon 1984, which I have now cited instead.

Sec 2, I think the assumption that all sources have the same intrinsic intensity is a very strong one. The true distribution of intrinsic intensities, or the effect of a particular distribution, perhaps warrants further discussion.
- Yes, this was indeed not well motivated. I have added a new paragraph to the end of Sect 2.4 describing what effect the instrinsic intensity distribution can have.

Sec 2.3, para 2 inverted comma around 'most' is backwards.
- Fixed

Sec 3.2, eq 17 variables are not defined.
- Fixed (now Eq 19).

Sec 3.2, 'where N the bin frequency' -> 'where N is the bin frequency'
- Fixed

Sec 6 the bullet points are not particularly concise, it may be better to expand as prose.
- Agree, I've partly rewritten Sect 6.2.
