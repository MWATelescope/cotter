\section{Introduction}

Observations from non-coplanar interferometric radio telescopes that image large fractions of the sky at once can not be imaged with simple imagers that are based on a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Instead, the imaging algorithm needs to account for the ``w-term'' during inversion, which is the term that describes the deviation of the array from a perfect plane \citep{perley-noncoplanar-arrays}. This deviation is amplified for telescopes with wide field of view, making this especially an issue for low-frequency telescopes, that by nature are wide-field instruments.

There are several methods to deal with the w-term during imaging: facetting \citep{facetting-cornwell}, a three-dimensional Fourier transform \citep{perley-noncoplanar-arrays}, w-projection \citep{wprojection-cornwell}, w-stacking \citep{widefield-imaging-ska-cornwell} and w-snapshots \citep{widefield-imaging-ska-cornwell}. The w-snapshots algorithm is a hybrid between snapshot imaging and one of the other w-term correcting techniques, most efficiently w-projection or w-stacking.

New generation of wide-field observatories are producing data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than before. Examples of such telescopes include the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA, \citealt{mwa}), the upgraded Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR, \citealt{lofar-2013}). The Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA, \citealt{casa-2007}, \citealt{casa-2008}) has an efficient implementation of the $w$-projection algorithm, with many available features such as multi-scale clean and spectral-shape fitting during deconvolution. However, at the MWA we have seen that imaging a 2-min snapshot observation at low-elevation can take up to tens of hours with CASA's w-projection algorithm. Larger images or higher zenith angles can be impossible to image because the size and number of $w$-kernels become too large to hold in memory.

Another option for reducing MWA data is the Real-Time System (RTS), which has been designed as an efficient calibrating and imaging pipeline specifically for MWA data \citep{rts-mwa}. It can use GPUs for improving efficiency, and uses a w-projection kernel during imaging to correct for the w-term. The kernel can be kept small, because the data is processed in snapshots that have been phase-centered to Zenith. The RTS can not perform deconvolution as of yet.

To reach high dynamic ranges, it can be necessary to deal with direction-dependent effects (DDEs). This is especially true for widefield telescopes. One way to handle DDEs is by using the a-projection technique, which convolves the data during gridding with a kernel that corrects the DDEs \citep{aprojection-2008}.
One such DDE is the effect of the ionosphere. For the MWA it can be assumed that the ionosphere has the same effect on all tiles, because the maximum baseline length is relatively small (2.9~km) and smaller than the typical size of ionospheric structure \citep{lonsdale-calibration-approaches-ionosphere}. This is not the case for LOFAR, making it necessary to correct the direction-dependent ionospheric effects per station before gridding the data. The \texttt{awimager} has been written to perform these corrections, and uses a hybrid of a-projection, w-projection and w-stacking \citep{awimager-2013}.

Once the Square-Kilometre Array (SKA) begins its operation, the required computational power for wide-field imaging will become an even bigger challenge. \citet{widefield-imaging-ska-cornwell} shows that in theory the w-snapshots algorithm is the most efficient approach for the SKA.

In this article, we present a new implementation of a generic wide-field imager that is significantly faster than CASA's w-projection implementation, and is able to succesfully image any MWA observation. To obtain the increase in speed, the implementation uses the w-stacking method for correcting the w-terms, optionally combined with w-snapshot imaging. We named the new imager ``WSClean'', as an abbreviation for ``W-Stacking Clean''. Our new imaging implementation, which we believe to be the fastest generic widefield imager available, is publicly released\footnote{TODO add URL}.

This paper is structured as follows: The $w$-stacking algorithm is described in Sect.~\ref{sec:wstacking}. Details of implementing the $w$-stacking and $w$-snapshots algorithms are described in Sect.~\ref{sec:implementation}. The performance and accuracy will be analysed in Sect.~\ref{sec:analysis}.

\section{The w-stacking technique} \label{sec:wstacking}
In this section, we will describe the $w$-stacking algorithm from a mathematical point of view.

An interferometer samples the complex visibility function
\begin{align}\notag
V(u,v,w) = & \iint \frac{A(l,m) I(l,m)}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} \cdot \\ \label{eq:visibility-function}
& e^{-2\pi i \left(ul + vm + w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)\right)} dl dm,
\end{align}
where $u,v,w$ is a baseline coordinate in the coordinate system of the array, $A$ is the primary-beam function, $I$ is the sky function and $l,m$ are cosine sky coordinates. We will use $I'(l,m)$ to denote the sky function before primary-beam correction, $I'(l,m)=A(l,m)I(l,m)$. We will not discuss calibration, but assume $V$ has been calibrated before imaging. In the case of a polarized measurement, the symbols $V$, $A$ and $I$ are $2\times 2$ matrices, but without loss of generality we will ignore polarization and treat inversion as a scalar problem. Imaging consists of inverting Eq.~\eqref{eq:visibility-function}, i.e., to find $I'$ from $V$.

For small field of views, the term $\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}$ is approximately of unit size, making Eq.~\eqref{eq:visibility-function} approximate an ordinary 2-dimensional Fourier transform, which can be inverted with an inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A common rule is that this is valid when
\begin{equation}\label{eq:when-2d-is-valid}
\forall w,l,m: w\left(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1\right) \ll 1.
\end{equation}

To derive the w-stacking technique, Eq.~\eqref{eq:visibility-function} is rewritten to
\begin{align}\notag
V(u,v,w) = & \iint \frac{I'(l,m) e^{-2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)}}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} \cdot \\ \notag
& e^{-2\pi i \left(ul + vm\right)} dl dm.
\end{align}
This is an ordinary two-dimensional Fourier transform going from $u,v$ space to $l,m$ space, and can be inverted to get:
% Intermediate step:
%\begin{align}\notag
%\frac{I'(l,m) e^{-2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)}}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} = & \iint V(u,v,w) \cdot \\ \notag
%& e^{-2\pi i \left(ul + vm\right)} du dv,
%\end{align}
%which can be rewritten to
\begin{align}\notag
\frac{I'(l,m)}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} = & e^{2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)} \iint V(u,v,w) \cdot \\ \notag
& e^{2\pi i \left(ul + vm\right)} du dv.
\end{align}
Integrating both sides over $w_0$ to $w_e$, the minimum and maximum value of $w$, results in
\begin{align}\notag
\frac{I'(l,m)\left(w_e - w_0\right)}{\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}} = \int\limits_{w_0}^{w_e} e^{2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)} \cdot \\ \label{eq:wstacking}
\iint V(u,v,w)  e^{2\pi i \left(ul + vm\right)} du dv dw.
\end{align}
The final step is to make the $u,v,w$ parameters discrete, so that the integration over $u$ and $v$ can become an inverse FFT and the integration over $w$ becomes a summation. This shows that the sky function can be reconstructed by i)~grid samples with equal $w$-value on a uniform grid; ii)~calculating the inverse FFT; iii)~apply the direction dependent phaseshift $e^{2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)}$; iv)~repeat this for all $w$-values and add the results together; v)~apply the final scaling.

In practice, the final scaling will be different from $\left(w_e - w_0\right)/\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}$ suggested by Eq.~\eqref{eq:wstacking}, because the individual $w$-layers will not be completely filled with samples. Therefore, the number of added samples and their weight have to be taken into account. Additionally, it might be required to divide out the effect of a possible convolution kernel, the primary beam and correct for other direction dependent effects. In XX, YY, LL or RR polarizations, a correlated baseline is the complex conjugate of the reversed baseline, and the relation $V(u,v,w)=\overline{V(-u,-v,-w)}$ holds. The right-hand side of Eq.\eqref{eq:wstacking} with only positive $w$-value samples then becomes the complex conjugate of the one with only negative $w$-values samples. In this case we can therefore calculate the image for $w<0$ from the image with $w>0$. That allows us to set $w_0$ to the minimum absolute $w$-value, which requires at least two times less layers. In any case, the input to the two-dimensional inverse FFT is not generally an Hermitian-symmetric function, and hence is always performed as a complex-to-complex transform. 

The inverse of imaging, i.e., to calculate the visibility from a model image, can be done by reversing the $w$-stacking algorithm: i)~inverse scale the image; ii)~copy the image to several layers; iii)~inverse apply the direction-dependent phaseshift for each layer; iv)~FFT each layer; and v)~sample a required visibility from the correct $w$-layer. We will refer to this operation as prediction.

\subsection{Discretization of w} \label{sec:gridding-w}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/aliasing-example-annotated}
\caption{Aliasing artefacts caused by insufficient $w$-layers in a simulated field. WSClean was set to use 12 $w$-layers. The centre of the image is at 10\degree zenith angle, which would normally require $\sim195$ $w$-layers. Sources are 1~Jy (red circles), ghost sources are approximately 0.2~Jy. Each source produces two ghost sources, but because they re-appear after a major cleaning cycle, they are eventually cleaned and produce more ghost sources. }
\label{fig:aliasing-example}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
While the discretization of $u$ and $v$ is similar to conventional imaging, the discretization of $w$ defines the number of w-layers that need to be processed. For this, one can use a rule similar to \eqref{eq:when-2d-is-valid}, and make sure that the phase difference for two subsequent discretized $w$-values, $w_A$ and $w_B$,  is less than one radian. This results in the constraint
\begin{equation} \label{eq:minimum-w-distance}
\left|\left(w_A - w_B\right) 2\pi (\sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}-1)\right| \ll 1.
\end{equation}
This suggest that a uniform discretization in $w$ is optimal (TODO this is in contrast to what Cornwell 2008 says -- Cornwell mailed me he made a mistake... Do we need to explicitly point that out here :-/ ?). From Eq.~\eqref{eq:minimum-w-distance}, the required number of layers can be derived and is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nwlayers-bound}
 N_\textrm{wlayers} \gg 2\pi \left(w_e - w_0\right) \max_{l,m} \left(1 - \sqrt{1-l^2-m^2}\right).
\end{equation}
Actual values for the right-hand side can differ a lot. The value of $w_e - w_0$ is influenced by the coplanarity of the array, the zenith angle and the wavelength, while the value of the $\max_{l,m}$ term is influenced by the angular size of the image. For the MWA, a typical value of $w_e - w_0$ is $\sim 10$ at zenith, but is already $\sim 400$ at a zenith angle of $30^{\circ}$. For a typical full-field-of-view image of a MWA observation of $3072\times 3072$ pixels of $0.75''$ size, the $\max_{l,m}$ term is $0.68$. This implies that tens of $w$-layers are required at zenith and hundreds at lower elevations. The number of $w$-layers has a large effect on the performance of the $w$-stacking algorithm, and will be discussed further in the next sections.

Using too few $w$-layers results in decorrelation of off-axis sources in the longer baselines. Additionally, $w$-aliasing errors can cause ghost sources in the image. An (extreme) example of this effect is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aliasing-example}. When Cotton-Schwab cleaning includes prediction with too few $w$-layers, incorrect values will be subtracted from the visibilities even when no aliased sources are cleaned during minor iterations. Therefore, accurate prediction is more important than accurate imaging, because aliasing artefacts are attenuated by cleaning as long as the model is subtracted accurately. Possible ways to allow less $w$-layers during imaging is by predicting with more $w$-layers or a direct Fourier transform. We have not looked into these options yet.

\subsection{Time complexity of w-stacking} \label{sec:time-complexity}
It is useful to analyse the time complexity of w-stacking and compare it with w-projection, to understand which algorithm performs better in a given situation. We will use the following symbols: $N_\textrm{wlay}$ is the number of w-layers for w-stacking, $N_\textrm{pix}$ is the number of pixels in the image along each dimension, $N_\textrm{vis}$ is the number of visibilities and $N_\textrm{kern}$ is the size of the antialiasing kernel (see \S\ref{sec:gridding}), $N_\textrm{wkern}$ is the size of the w-kernel for w-projection, $w_e$ is the maximum $w$ value and $\alpha_\textrm{FOV}$ is the imaging field of view.

\begin{table}
 \caption{Scaling of the computational cost for various imaging steps} \label{tbl:computational-cost-per-operation}
 \begin{tabular}{lll}
   \textbf{Operation} & \textbf{W-stacking} & \textbf{W-projection} \\
   \hline\hline
   Fourier transform(s) & $N_\textrm{wlay} N^2_\textrm{pix} \log N_\textrm{pix}$ & $N^2_\textrm{pix} \log N_\textrm{pix}$ \\
   W-term corrections   & $N_\textrm{wlay} N^2_\textrm{pix}$ & $N_\textrm{vis} N^2_\textrm{wkern}$ \\
   Gridding & $N_\textrm{vis}N^2_\textrm{kern}$ & $N_\textrm{vis} N_\textrm{kern}^2$ \\
   \hline\hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tbl:computational-cost-per-operation} shows how the computational costs scale for the operations that dominate the imaging in the w-stacking and w-projection algorithms. For comparison, we can assume the gridding kernel adds a constant term and the terms $N_\textrm{wlay}$ and $N_\textrm{wkern}$ follow approximately $w_e \sin \alpha_\textrm{FOV}$. The time complexity for w-stacking is then given by
\begin{equation}
\textrm{TC}_\textrm{wstacking}=\mathcal{O}\left(N^2_\textrm{pix} \log N_\textrm{pix} w_e \sin \alpha_\textrm{FOV}+ N_\textrm{vis} \right),
\end{equation}
and for $w$-projection it is
\begin{equation}
\textrm{TC}_\textrm{wprojection}=\mathcal{O}\left(N^2_\textrm{pix} \log N_\textrm{pix} + N_\textrm{vis} w_e^2 \sin^2 \alpha_\textrm{FOV}\right).
\end{equation}
From these bounds it can be concluded that in the limiting behaviour, the $w$-stacking method will be faster when the gridding of the visibilities is the dominating cost of the algorithm. The $w$-projection algorithm will be faster when the inverse FFTs are dominating. In Sect.~\ref{sec:analysis} we will determine which method is faster in practice for different parameters.

\section{The WSClean imager implementation} \label{sec:implementation}
With the purpose of testing new algorithms for the imaging of MWA data, we have written a new imager around the $w$-stacking algorithm. As will be shown in Sect.~\ref{sec:application-to-nonmwa}, the imager is not specialized for the MWA, and has been succesfully used for imaging data from other telescopes.

The new imager, called ``WSClean'', is written in the C++ language. It reads visibilities from CASA measurement sets and writes output images to Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files. Several steps are multi-threaded using the threading module of the C++11 standard library. These are: reading and writing; gridding from and to different $w$-layers; performing the Fast Fourier transforms; and H\"ogbom Clean iterations (peak-finding and image subtraction, \citealt{hogbom-clean}). For the latter, intrinsics are used as well. Because of these optimizations, minor Cleaning iterations with an image size of $3072\times3072$ are performed at a rate of hundreds per second. This is fast enough to make the Clark Clean optimization \citep{clark-clean}, which consists of considering only a subset of pixels with a reduced PSF, less relevant. However, the PSF varies for imaging with non-zero $w$-values, and subtracting a constant PSF in image space leads to inaccuracies. After a number of minor iterations, it is therefore beneficial to invert the model back to the visibilities via prediction, and subtract the model directly from the visibilities \citep{wprojection-cornwell}. This is similar to the Cotton-Schwab cleaning method \citep{cotton-schwab-clean}.

It will not be possible to store all $w$-layers in memory when creating large images or when many $w$-layers are used. For example, our 32-GB test machine can store 227 $w$-layers of $3072\times3072$ in memory. In more demanding imaging configurations, the implementation performs several passes over the measurement set and will grid a subset of $w$-layers in each pass.

\subsection{Full-sky imaging}
For low-frequency telescopes, it can be of interest to do full-sky (i.e., horizon to horizon) imaging. In the case of MWA, the tile beam can have strong sidelobes at a distance of more than 90\degree from the pointing centre. Imaging these sidelobes might be relevant because they are scientifically of interest (e.g. when searching for transients). Full-sky imaging can also be useful for self-calibration or deconvolution. For example, self-calibration using full-sky clean components has been found to give good results in imaging the resolved FR-II radio source Fornax~A (McKinley et al., in prep.).

To efficiently image the full sky, an observation is split into short snapshots, their phase centre is changed to zenith and subsequently a suitable area is imaged. Depending on desired resolution and dynamic range, this might require very large images. To make an image at the MWA resolution, the image needs to have approximately 10K pixels in width and height. The $w$-values will be very small at zenith, because at zenith only the vertical offsets of the antennas will contribute to the $w$-value. For the MWA, the maximum height difference between tiles is $8.5$m. The MWA tiles are in fact on a slight slope, and by fitting a plane to the antennas and changing the phase centre towards the normal of that plane, the maximum $w$-value decreases to $5.5\textrm{m} / \lambda$. In the following sections, when discussing the MWA zenith direction we are referring to this optimal $w$-direction.

\subsection{W-snapshots} \label{sec:snapshot-imaging}
\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/vela-normal-projection}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/vela-zenith-projection}
\caption{13-min MWA observation of supernova remnants Vela and Puppis A. Left: normal projection centred on Puppis A, right: phase-rotated to zenith to reduce $w$-values, recentred on Puppis A during imaging. Both Stokes-I images have been made with WSClean using the Cotton-Schwab clean algorithm. No beam correction was applied. Computing cost was 60 min for the normal projected image and 41 min for the recentred image.}
\label{fig:vela-projection-example}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}
As discussed, all-sky snapshot imaging with zenith as phase centre is quite efficient. However, if one is not interested in imaging the whole sky, and the direction of interest is far from zenith, the computational overhead of making all-sky images is undesirable.

Instead of imaging the whole sky, the image can be recentred from $(l,m)$ to $(\hat{l},\hat{m})=(l+\Delta l,m+\Delta m)$ by performing the substitution $(l,m)\leftarrow(\hat{l},\hat{m})$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:wstacking}:
%When the Fourier transform is performed, the $w$ term has been corrected (either by w-stacking or by w-projection). Therefore, if $U(u, v)$ is the input to the 2-dimensional Fourier transform, the transform is described by
\begin{align}\notag
\frac{I'(\hat{l}, \hat{m})\left(w_e - w_0\right)}{\sqrt{1-\hat{l}^2-\hat{m}^2}} = \int\limits_{w_0}^{w_e} e^{2\pi i w(\sqrt{1-\hat{l}^2-\hat{m}^2}-1)} \cdot \\
\iint e^{2 \pi i \left(u\Delta l + v\Delta m\right)} V(u,v,w) e^{2\pi i \left(ul + vm\right)} du dv dw.
\end{align}
In words, recentering an image involves accounting for the position shift during the $w$-correction and final scaling, and shifting the visibilities in phase by multiplication with $e^{2 \pi i \left(u\Delta l + v\Delta m\right)}$ prior to the imaging. This essentially is a method of implementing the $w$-snapshots algorithm as described by \citet{widefield-imaging-ska-cornwell}. By doing the inverse corrections during prediction, such a shifted visibility set can be cleaned with Cotton-Schwab iterations similar to a non-shifted set.

A recentred image is in the projection of the zenith tangent plane, and will need an additional regridding step before multiple snapshots can be added together. A recentred image can be stored in a Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) file, which allows setting the centre of tangent projection with the \texttt{CRPIXi} keyword \citep{wcs-in-fits}. Common viewers such as Kvis and DS9 support such FITS files and display their coordinates correctly. An example of the difference in projection is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:vela-projection-example}, which displays a 13~min MWA observation imaged with WSClean. Cleaning an image that is in a different projection yields slightly different results, but qualitativily the two images are clearly of equal accuracy. The wall-clock time for imaging is 60 min and 41 min for respectively normal projection and the recentred image. Of the 41 min, 3 min is spent on phase rotating the visibilities.

Another method to shift an image is by using the periodicity of the FFT function. Since sources outside the field of view will be aliased back into the field, the image can be transformed to have the alias in the centre. This complicates gridding during imaging, because the antialiasing kernel needs to have a pass-band shape instead of a low-pass shape. Therefore, we chose to implement the former method.

\subsection{Beam correction}
Because the MWA consists of fixed, beamformed dipole antennas, the voltage beam of a MWA tile is described by a complex, non-diagonal Jones matrix. Alternatively, Mueller matrices can be used as well, but in general these result in more computations \citep{revisiting-me-i}. When assuming all individual antennas of the tiles are working properly, all tiles have the same beam. The beam can then be corrected in image space for all tiles at once with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beam-correction}
 I(l, m) = J(l,m)^{-1} I'(l, m) \left(J(l,m)^*\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
where each term is a $2\times2$ complex matrices, with $J$ the voltage beam and $^*$ denoting the conjugate transpose. Because $J$ is complex and non-diagonal, all 4 combinations of the cross-correlated polarizations $p$ and $q$\footnote{The instrumental polarizations of the MWA are informally often referred to as $X$ and $Y$, mainly because many software treats the two polarizations as such. However, this is not correct, because $X$ is defined as being parallel to the celestial equator.} including the imaginary part of the $pq$ and $qp$ are required to calculate any of the Stokes parameters. The $pp$ and $qq$ have no imaginary part due to the $uv$-symmetry. To make proper MWA beam correction possible, WSClean can output both real $pp$, $pq$, $qp$, $qq$ images and imaginary $pq$ and $qp$ images. Each polarization requires a separate run of the $w$-stacking algorithm. Once these six images are created, a separate program is used to perform the correction of Eq.~\eqref{eq:beam-correction}. This method avoids expensive beam-correcting kernels during gridding, but only works because all tiles have the same beam. To apply the same method on heterogeneous arrays such as LOFAR, each set of correlations with a different combination of station beams will have to be imaged separately, which will increase the cost of the algorithm excessively unless an a-projection kernel is used. The AWImager uses an intermediate method, and corrects a common dipole factor in image space and the phased-array beam factor in $uv$-space, which allows the gridding kernel to be smaller compared to correcting both in $uv$-space \citep{awimager-2013}.

\subsection{Gridding} \label{sec:gridding}
A gridding convolution kernel improves the accuracy of gridding in $uv$-space. A common kernel function is a windowed sinc function, which acts as a low-pass filter. This decreases the flux of sources outside the field of view, and thus helps to attenuate aliased ghost sources and sidelobes that arise because of the assumed periodicity during the inverse FFT \citep{post-correlation-filtering}. By supersampling, a convolution kernel also makes it possible to place samples more accurately at their $uv$ position, thereby lowering decorrelation.

The prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) is generally considered to be the optimal windowing function for gridding \citep{fourier-kernel-selection-1991}. CASA convolves samples with a PSWF of 7 pixels total width during gridding. When using a variable kernel size, a PSWF is quite complicated and computational expensive to calculate. WSClean currently uses a Kaiser-Bessel (KB) window function, which is easy and fast to compute, and is a good approximation for the PSWF \citep{fourier-kernel-selection-1991}. After some benchmarks (see Appendix~\ref{sec:gridding-appendix}) we found that 7 pixels is a good compromise between performance and accuracy, and this is the default for WSClean.

\section{Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}
We will now analyse the performance and accuracy of our implementation, and compare it with the w-projection implementation in CASA. For the analysis, we use imaging parameters which are common for MWA Imaging. When a specific parameter value is not mentioned, the settings from Table~\ref{tbl:default-parameters} are used. The number of $w$-projection planes in w-projection is kept equal to the number of $w$-layers in w-stacking, and is set to the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:nwlayers-bound}. This yields 195 $w$-planes/layers at 10\degree zenith angle. Some configurations with high $w$-values fail to image with CASA, presumably because the $w$-kernels become to large.

The used software version of CASA is ``stable release 42.0, revision 26465'', which was released September 2013. It includes performance improvements to the \texttt{clean} task which have recently been made. For WSClean, the latest version as of February 2014 was used. The tests were run on a high-end desktop with 32 GB of memory and a 3.20-GHz Intel Core i7-3930K processor with 6 cores that can perform 138 giga-floating point operations per second (GFLOPS). The data are stored on a multi-disk array with 5 spinning hard disks, which has a combined read rate of about 450 MB/s.

The panels show a small part of the full images. The full field contains 100 simulated sources over 20\degree. Sources in the image produced with CASA are slightly less accurately subtracted, leading to a residual noise level of 1.07 mJy and some visible artefacts, whereas WSClean reaches 0.90 mJy. Since the effect is stronger away from the phase centre, it is likely that this is caused by the finite size of the w-kernels used in w-projection, which leads to inaccuracies.}
\label{fig:residuals}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

To assess the accuracy of WSClean and CASA, we simulate a MWA observation with hundred sources of 1~Jy in a 20\degree diameter area, without adding system noise. A unitary primary beam is assumed. We image the simulated set with WSClean and CASA using Cotton-Schwab cleaning to a threshold of 10~mJy. The two imagers calculate slightly different restoring (synthesized) beams, hence to avoid bias the restoring beams are fixed. Other imaging parameters are given in Table~\ref{tbl:default-parameters}. The Aegean program \citep{aegean-hancock-2012} is used to perform source detection on the produced images. Sidelobe noise of the residual 10~mJy source structures triggers a few false detections. These are ignored.

Table~\ref{tbl:accuracy-measurements} lists the measured RMS in the residual image and the standard errors of the source brightnesses as detected by Aegean. In all tests, WSClean performs slightly more accurate. At zenith, CASA produces a residual RMS twice as high as WSClean. This is caused by the fact that we keep the number of $w$-projection planes in w-projection equal to the number of w-layers in w-stacking, resulting in only 12 $w$-planes at zenith. This evidently has a stronger effect on the $w$-projection algorithm. However, the computational performance of the $w$-projection algorithm is hardly affected by the number of $w$-projection planes, and in practical situations one would always use more w-projection planes\footnote{In the zenith case CASA issues a warning to use more $w$-projection planes.}. When 128 $w$-projection planes are used in CASA, its residual RMS is equal to WSClean with 12 $w$-layers, but the flux density measurements are less accurate. We do not know why this parameter needs to be higher in CASA to reach the same RMS.\footnote{TODO: do I want to find out this is because of invalid sqrt(w) gridding?} Eq.~\eqref{eq:nwlayers-bound} results in $N_\textrm{wlayers}\gg 6$ for the top-left image pixel that is 26\degree away from the centre, while the sources are all within 10\degree. Also unexpected is that the source flux density becomes worse by increasing the number of planes. For WSClean both values stay approximately the same when the number of $w$-layers is increased.

In the $\textrm{ZA}=10\degree$ case, CASA is slightly less accurate. The extra noise can be observed in the produced images, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals}. Also made is an image with the technique of recentring a zenith phase-centred visibility set, as described in Sect.~\ref{sec:snapshot-imaging}. Its accuracy is higher compared to the normal projection, but its residual noise is also higher. The reprojection technique needs on average fewer $w$-layers to reach the same level of accuracy.

WSClean is faster in all tested cases. WSClean and CASA determine a different next major iteration threshold. CASA performs 5 major iterations at zenith and 8 at 10\degree angle, while WSClean always performs 5 major iterations. Major iterations are dominating the computing time. We will look more closely at the difference in performance in the next section.

\subsection{Performance analysis}

We measured the performance of the imagers using several MWA data sets. Each specific configuration is run 5 times and standard deviations are calculated. The variations between runs is typically a few seconds. In each benchmark, the wall-clock time is measured that is required to produce the synthesized point-spread function and the image itself. No cleaning or prediction was performed. The results are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:timings}.

Panel~\ref{fig:timing-nsamples} shows the dependency on the size of the visibility set. Results for imaging at zenith and 10\degree zenith angle (ZA) are shown. The size of the visibility set was varied by changing the time resolution, which affects the number of visibilities to be gridded without changing the maximum $w$-value. For larger sets, both methods show a linear time dependency on the number of visibilities. This implies that gridding or reading dominates the cost. In that situation, the $w$-stacking implementation is 7.9 times faster at $\textrm{ZA}=10\degree$ and 2.6 times faster at $\textrm{ZA}=0\degree$. With small data volumes, the FFTs start to dominate the cost. This is visible from Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-nsamples} by the flattening towards the left. At that point, WSClean is in both cases approximately 3 times faster. At zenith, the two methods are expected to perform almost identical. The factor of 2-3 difference in Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-nsamples} could be due to different choices in optimizations.

In Panel~\ref{fig:timing-zenith-angle}, the computational cost as function of zenith angle is plotted. It shows that, as expected from \S\ref{sec:time-complexity}, the $w$-projection algorithm is more affected by the increased $w$-values, leading to differences of more than an order of magnitude at zenith angles of $\gtrapprox 20$\degree. Additionally, at higher zenith angles, the $w$-kernels become too large to be able to make images of 3072 pixels or larger. Using the recentering technique to decrease the $w$-values makes the computational cost approximately constant. However, the additional time required to rephase and regrid the measurement set makes it only worthwhile for images $\ge3072$ pixels and $\textrm{ZA}\ge15\degree$. This is dependent on the speed of rotating the phase centre and regridding. Our program to change the phase centre is currently not multi-threaded, so its performance might be improvable.

In Panel~\ref{fig:timing-resolution}, the number of pixels in the image is changed without changing the field of view. The performance of $w$-stacking is more affected by the size of the image, but is still significantly faster in making 12.8K images at 10\degree ZA than $w$-projection. 

The cost of spectral imaging, i.e. imaging multiple frequencies, is the cost of making an image from fewer visibilities times the number of desired frequencies. Panel~\ref{fig:timing-channels} shows performance versus the spectral output resolution. As can be expected from the previous results, FFTs become the dominant cost for such small visibility sets, and the number of imaged frequencies affect performance linearly.

As can be seen in Panel~\ref{fig:timing-fov}, the field of view (FOV) has a large affect on performance when imaging off-zenith. This plot was created by varying the size of the pixel in the output image, such that the number of pixels in the image did not change. The FOV is calculated as angle between the left and right most pixel in the image. CASA is not able to make off-zenith images larger than $\sim30$\degree, and its imaging cost increases much more rapidly compared to the cost of WSClean, which implies that gridding is the major cost in this scenario. The image recentering technique is clearly beneficial for FOVs larger than $\sim30$\degree, and can even make a difference of an order of magnitude at very large FOVs of $\sim90$\degree.

%It is important to point out that all these measurement were performed by imaging a single polarization. Making full-polarization images with WSClean currently requires four runs. Imaging four Stokes parameters with CASA costs slightly less than four times the time of imaging a single polarization. With the settings of Table~\ref{tbl:default-parameters}, the difference is a factor of $3.5$, and imaging XX and YY together costs $1.9$ times imaging just XX.

\subsection{Derivation of computing cost formulae}
Based on the expected cost terms described in Sec.~\ref{sec:time-complexity}, we derive analytical functions for the CASA and WSClean measurements using least-squares fitting. Several functions with different free parameters were tested, and formulae with minimum amount of parameters are selected that still follow the trend of the measurements and have reasonably small errors. Measurements are weighted with the inverse standard deviation. The single outlying measurement for $N_\textrm{pix}=1792$ with CASA in Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-resolution} is removed.

For the WSClean time-cost function $t_\textrm{WSClean}$ we find 
\begin{align}\label{eq:wsclean-computing-cost}
& t_\textrm{WSClean} (w_e,N_\textrm{Mvis},N_\textrm{freq},N_\textrm{kpix}) = \\ \notag%
& N_\textrm{freq} \left( 0.452 N_\textrm{kpix}^2 \log_2 N_\textrm{kpix} (w_e + 0.611) + 244 N_\textrm{Mvis} \right)
\end{align}
and for CASA we find
\begin{align}\label{eq:casa-computing-cost}
& t_\textrm{CASA}(w_e,N_\textrm{vis},N_\textrm{freq},N_\textrm{pix}) = \\ \notag%
& N_\textrm{freq} \left(1.03 N_\textrm{kpix}^2 \log_2 N_\textrm{kpix} + 5.93 N_\textrm{Mvis} (w_e + 1.71)^2\right) + 172.
\label{eq:casa-computing-cost}%
\end{align}
Parameter $w_e$ is the maximum $w$ value and is estimated with
\begin{equation}
 w_e = \frac{1}{\lambda}\left[\max |\Delta \mathbf{x}| \sin \textrm{ZA} + \max \Delta z \cos \textrm{ZA} \left(1.0 - \cos(\frac{1}{2}\textrm{FOV})\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where $\max |\Delta \mathbf{x}|$ is the maximum baseline length, $\max \Delta z$ is the maximum height difference between antennas and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. These functions follow the trend of the measurements well, with an absolute error of 14.7\% and 20.7\% for respectively the WSClean and CASA functions.

\subsection{Optimal snapshot duration}
Snapshot imaging can in theory be implemented with either $w$-projection or $w$-stacking. Using the derived formula, we can estimate the cost of making snapshots with both techniques. Snapshot imaging effectively removes the dependency on ZA from $w_e$. Given the snapshot duration $\Delta \tau_\textrm{snapshot}$ and the total integration time $\Delta \tau_\textrm{total}$, the total time cost of inversion becomes
\begin{equation} \label{eq:snapshot-cost}
t_\textrm{snapshot}(\Delta \tau_\textrm{snapshot}) = \frac{\Delta \tau_\textrm{total}}{\Delta \tau_\textrm{snapshot}} t_\textrm{imaging}(w'_e,N'_\textrm{vis},N_\textrm{freq},N_\textrm{pix}),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
w'_e = \frac{1}{\lambda}\max \Delta z \left(1.0 - \cos(\frac{1}{2}(\textrm{FOV} + \omega_E \tau_\textrm{snapshot})\right),
\end{equation}
$\omega_E$ the rotational speed of the Earth and $N'_\textrm{vis} = N_\textrm{vis}\frac{\Delta \tau_\textrm{total}}{\tau_\textrm{snapshot}}$. We have excluded the cost of phase shifting the visibilities and gridding. The cost for regridding with simple nearest neighbour or bilinair interpolation is indeed negligable, although more accurate interpolation (e.g. Lanczos interpolation) can be expensive. Also, our current implementation of the phase-changing program does take a non-negligable time, but this implementation is not optimized and can in theory be implemented in a preprocessing pipeline or on the fly during imaging.

Function $t_\textrm{snapshot}$ can be minimized to find the optimal snapshot duration. For WSClean with MWA parameters, we find that this function decreases but no minimum is reached for $\Delta \tau_\textrm{snapshot}<24$~h. Therefore, from a performance perspective, the snapshot duration should be as large as possible. For $w$-projection in CASA we find an optimal snapshot duration of 122~s for MWA observations.

\subsection{Estimated computing cost for other telescopes} \label{sec:application-to-nonmwa}
We use the derived functions to estimate the computational cost of the algorithms for configurations of several telescopes. We estimate the cost of imaging an hour of ZA=20\degree data for the following surveys or array configurations: The Galactic and Extragalactic MWA survey (GLEAM); the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) ASKAP survey \citep{emu-norris-2011}; the low and high bands of the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS)\footnote{See \url{https://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/lofar-msss/lofar-msss}}; the Amsterdam—ASTRON Radio Transients Facility and Analysis Centre (AARTFAAC) project\footnote{See \url{http://www.aartfaac.org}}; The VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey (VLSS, \citealt{vlss-2007}); and the low-frequency phase~1 aperture arrays of the Square-Kilometre Array, with inner (2.5~km) and mid (2.5~km) configurations \citep{ska-phase1-2010}. In multi-beam configurations such as the SKA and EMU configurations, we assume each beam is imaged separately, i.e., the FOV of a single beam is used and the computing cost is multiplied with the number of beams. 

\subsection{Combination of $w$-projection and $w$-stacking}
To combine the $w$-projection and $w$-stacking algorithms, small $w$-corrections are made before the FFTs using a $w$-correcting kernel and large $w$-terms are corrected after the FFTs by gridding onto several $w$-layers. This allows using small $w$-kernels and limits at the same time the number of FFTs and required memory. The AWImager has been applied like this, which let to better results compared to $w$-projection without $w$-stacking \citep{awimager-2013}. For this scenario, Eq.~\eqref{eq:casa-computing-cost} can be used to determine the optimal number of $w$-layers, or more generally the optimal distance between layers, by assuming that the cost of calculating a single $w$-layer equals the cost of imaging the data set with correspondingly smaller $w_e$ value and smaller $N_\textrm{vis}$. If $\Delta w$ is the distance between $w$-layers, then 
\begin{equation}
t(\Delta w) = \frac{w_e}{\Delta w} t_\textrm{CASA}(w'_e,N'_\textrm{vis},N_\textrm{freq},N_\textrm{pix}),
\end{equation}
with $N'_\textrm{vis} = N_\textrm{vis}\frac{\Delta w}{w_e}$ and $w'_e = \Delta w$.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:discussion}
We have shown that the $w$-stacking algorithm is well suited for imaging MWA observations. The WSClean $w$-stacking implementation is faster than CASA's $w$-projection algorithm in all common MWA imaging configurations, leading up to an order of magnitude difference already at a relatively small zenith angle of $10$\degree. It is also slightly more accurate. For approximately zenith angles $>15\degree$ or field-of-view diameters $>35\degree$, snapshot imaging becomes faster. This can lead to performance improvements of a factor of $3$ for the MWA, but only in the most expensive imaging configurations that are less commonly used. Considering the extra regridding step required, which complicates issues such as calculating the integrated beam shape, recentering snapshots might not be worthwhile for the MWA. Extrapolation of the computing cost predicts that this holds for most arrays, including SKA low. A hybrid between $w$-stacking and $w$-projection might improve things by a few factors.

It remains challenging to deconvolve observations that are long enough to encur significant changes in the beam shape. It is possible to clean an observation integrated over time without beam corrections, but this will subtract a constant (absolute) flux over time. Alternatively, beam corrections can be made, either by integrating beam-corrected snapshots or by performing $a$-projection. This however leads to a stronger spatially-varying point-spread function, and would allow fewer image-based minor iterations in a major cycle. When it is required to calculate the beam on short time scales, calculating $a$-projection kernels or performing snapshot imaging also becomes much more expensive. For a few thousand components, an approach with direct Fourier transforms is accurate and affordable, but this becomes intractable for tens of thousands of components. Images with diffuse emmission typically require cleaning that many components.

Deconvolution is not an issue for achieving low to intermediate dynamic range with the MWA. Because of sufficient instanteneous $uv$-coverage and near-confusion snapshot noise level, snapshots can be cleaned individually to deep levels. For example, cleaning to $5\sigma$ level results in a cleaning threshold of approximately 100~mJy in 112~s observations. However, MWA's EoR observations (TODO cite) require more advanced deconvolution techniques.

By using the $w$-stacking algorithms, some computational cost is transferred from gridding to performing FFTs. WSClean uses the FFTW library for calculating the FFTs \citep{fftw-2005}. Further performance improvement can be made by using a FFT library that is executed on graphical processing units (GPUs).

TODO The results show that synthesis imaging using common imaging parameters results in an approximate flux-density standard error of at least $\sim1\%$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
As discussed in \S\ref{sec:gridding}, WSClean uses a Kaiser-Bessel window against aliasing. The type of window function has no effect on the gridding performance, but the size of the kernel affects gridding performance quadratically. Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-kernelsize} shows that this quadratic relation becomes significant for kernel sizes $\gtrapprox 10$. Decreasing the kernel size to values below $7$ has little effect on performance, because for small kernels the visibility-reading rate is lower than the gridding rate. We have not noticed much benefit of larger kernels except in rare cases where a bright source lies just outside the imaged field of view. Therefore, WSClean uses a default of 7 pixels for the gridding kernel. It can be increased when necessary. Of course, different hardware might give slightly different results because of different reading and calculation performance.
